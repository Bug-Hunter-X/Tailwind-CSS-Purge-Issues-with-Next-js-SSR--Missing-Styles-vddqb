This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR).  The problem is that Tailwind's purge functionality, which removes unused CSS classes, may not be working correctly in the SSR environment. This leads to the absence of some expected styles in the rendered HTML, resulting in unexpected visual presentation or layout issues.

Example (Next.js):
```javascript
// pages/index.js

import Image from 'next/image';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-red-500 p-4">
      <p>This text should be red.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

The `bg-red-500` class might not be included in the final CSS bundle due to the purging process not accounting for the component correctly in SSR.
